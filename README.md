### Discourse News

The News Plugin is a [Discourse plugin](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) that adds a new "News" route to your forum. The latest topics in a category(s) (or from an RSS feed) are displayed in a large, news-like format, with an optional sidebar with a topic list. It adds a link to the News route in the header bar.

It is inspired by the [Elektronauts news feed](https://www.elektronauts.com/news).

- The place to report bugs or request features is over at [thepavilion.io](https://thepavilion.io). It's easier for us to manage them there, than across multiple repositories.
